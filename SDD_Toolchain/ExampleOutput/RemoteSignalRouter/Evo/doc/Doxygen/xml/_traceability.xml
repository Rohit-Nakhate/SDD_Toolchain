<para><bold>Traceability - SWR and SWDD</bold> <linebreak/>
 The traceability between SWR and SWDD (model and implementation) is established on SW unit and function/code level by requirements identifier links. <linebreak/>
 The overview of the requirements allocation on file level can be found here: TODO LINK (TODO overview generator: list of req - list in which file implemented) The overview of the requirements allocation on function level can be found here: TODO LINK (TODO overview generator: list of req - list in which function implemented)</para><para><bold>Traceability - SWA and SWDD</bold> <linebreak/>
 The traceability between SWA and SWDD is established by using an identical component name.<linebreak/>
 <bold>Traceability - SWDD and Implementation</bold> <linebreak/>
 The traceability between SWDD and implementation is established by using identical sw unit names (in SWDD and implementation).<linebreak/>
